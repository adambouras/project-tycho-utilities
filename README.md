# project-tycho-utilities

Utilities to work with the awesome data from Project Tycho:

Willem G. van Panhuis, John Grefenstette, Su Yon Jung, Nian Shong Chok, Anne Cross, Heather Eng, Bruce Y Lee, Vladimir Zadorozhny, Shawn Brown, Derek Cummings, Donald S. Burke. Contagious Diseases in the United States from 1888 to the present. NEJM 2013; 369(22): 2152-2158.

At this point, this is only building an SQLite database from the Level 2 data (downloading the data). Easy to run though:

```sh
make all
```

## Requirements:

- make
- wget
- unzip
- gzip
- python3
